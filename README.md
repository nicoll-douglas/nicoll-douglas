# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Nicoll** - I'm a passionate and aspiring web developer based in London. To summarise myself in one sentence, I would say I make it my core mission to freely express myself through my web projects and create high quality websites and applications that are a joy to useâ€”at a fundamental level, I think that's what software engineering is all about.

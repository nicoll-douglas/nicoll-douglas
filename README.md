# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nicoll - I'm a passionate and aspiring web developer based in London. To summarise myself in one sentence, I would say I make it my core mission to freely express myself through my web projects and create high quality websites and applications that are a joy to use. I think that's what software engineering is all about.

Take a look around and links are on the sidebar for more about me!
